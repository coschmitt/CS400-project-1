Once upon a time there was a boy named Finn who loved to play the piano. He practiced day and night, slowly becoming an excellent pianist. One day Finn had an important recital where all his friends were in attendance. His hands were sweaty and knees were shaking; he had never performed in front of this many people!
Finn slowly walked up onto the grand stage. The recital was being held at Phi Gamma Delta, so he knew that he had a tough crowd to please. He expected to see many smiling faces, but instead to his surprise saw everyone laughing at him. His so called friends doubted his performance, and he was terrified to see their reaction. Nevertheless, slowly but surely, Finn took his seat at the piano and took a deep breath. He then began to perform a beautiful rendition of Mozart's Symphony 40 in G minor. Finn's performance brought tears to the eyes of many, including his arch nemisis Remi. All was well until Remi decided to challenge Finn.
